# 0x03. C# - Data Structures: HashSet, Stack, Queue, LinkedList

## About
This is the second part of C# - Data Structures. This time, we will experiment on the following data structures/collections:

- **HashSet**: Unsorted set with high-performance operations.
- **Stack**: Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) based storage; All elements go to the top of the stack and can only be removed from the top.
- **Queue**: First-In, First-Out (FIFO) data structure; All elements go to the back of the queue and can only be removed from the front.
- **LinkedList**: Node based storage. _C# implements Doubly Linked Lists_.
