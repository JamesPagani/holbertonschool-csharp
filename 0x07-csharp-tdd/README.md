# 0x07. C# - Test Driven Development

## About
This project covers how Test Driven Development (TDD) can be done in C#, thanks to the NUnit framework. Also, due to the need to have two directories, one for the actual project and another for the test, we also get a brief introduction to C#'s Solutions.
