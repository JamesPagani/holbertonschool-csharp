# 0x0A. C# - Generics

## About
In this project, we take a look at C#'s **Generics**, which allows us to create data structures and methods whose data type is established later in the code, giving us a great way to reuse code without worrying (too much) about it's data type. 

Of course, it is recommended to keep using the generics that are built-in with C# (by importing `System.Collections.Generics`), but for the purpose of learning how to create them and how they work, we are making a *generic queue*.
