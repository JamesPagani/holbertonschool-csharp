# 0x0C. C# - Delegates and events

## About
Delegates are C#'s approach to C/C++ function pointers, with its main function being storing methods. Unlike function pointers, however, these are capable of storing more than one method (multicasting) and can be used as parameters for other methods.

Events are a derivate of delegates, being used to notify other classes or objects when something of interest happens. What they do when that event triggers is up to the developer.
