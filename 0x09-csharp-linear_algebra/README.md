# 0x09. C# - Linear Algebra

## About this project
Due to the importance of Linear Algebra and computer graphics in general, this project is dedicated to reviwing Linear Algebra.

Part of the concepts we reviewed includes:
- Vectors
    - Additions
    - Scalar multiplication
    - Dot product
    - Cross product
- Matrices
- Vector basis

## Contents
This project is divided acording to the topic reviewed.
1. Pythagoras
    - 0-pythagoras: Given the lengths of two sides of a triangle, calculate the other side.
2. Vector magnitude
    - 1-magnitude_2D: Finding the magnitude of a 2-Dimensional vector.
    - 2-magnitude_3D: Finding the magnitude of a 3-Dimensional vector.
