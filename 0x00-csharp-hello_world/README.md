# 0x00. C# - Hello World

## About this project
This project covers how to start and run a C# project _without using Visual Studio_ and the basics of printing text to the screen using the `Console.WriteLine` method.

## Contents
- `0-initialize_new_project.sh`: A bash script that starts a new C# project
- `1-build_new_project.sh`: A bash script that, on top of starting a new C# project, builds it.
- `2-run_new_project.sh`: A bash script that does the same as the previous scripts, but also runs the project.
- `3-writeline`: A folder/C# project. Running the project will print a string to the screen.
- `4-print_integer`: A folder/C# project. Running the project will print a string and a formated integer.
- `5-print_float`: A folder/C# project. Running the project will print the stored float with only two digits.
- `6-print_string`: A folder/C# project. Running the project will print the stored string in two different ways.
- `7-concat`: A folder/C# project. This project concatenates two strings when printing.
- `8-print_variables`: A folder/C# project. Prints all variables, one of which is an integer.
- `9-print_specifiers`: A folder/C# project. Prints two lines, each with a specific format.
- `10-copy_cut_paste`: A folder/C# project. Prints specific lenghts of three strings.
- `11-concat_edges`: A folder/C# project. Print a new sentence out of a (big) string.

### Disclaimer
For the C# project/folders, I will not upload the `bin/` and `obj/` folders.
